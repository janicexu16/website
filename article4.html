										<h2>COVID-19: The New Reality</h2>
										<p>How our lives will have changed forever...</p>
									</header>
									<p>And with a blink of an eye, you wake up, another day, another hour thinking about that psychology midterm that you needed to write but self reported because you didn't think you could learn all the content in time. All of a sudden, Twitter feeds explode with the breaking news: Classes Cancelled Until 2021. Online Classes Resume into the Winter and Fall. You think to yourself, perhaps this calls for a celebration? A need to study for the psychology midterm? Or even pack up all your bags to head home.
</br></br>
As students barraged through the Ontario Hall wings in celebration, all I could think about was how did this virus exist through Christmas, yet, safety precautions were only being put in place now. What seemed to be a temporary move out, resulted in never coming back again, never saying goodbye to the floormates I had encountered everyday.
</br></br>
As Ontario begins its phases of reopening, precautions continue to be implemented such as restricted dining areas, plastic screens, and the continuation of the mask. It makes you wonder, will you ever be able to engage in group activities, team celebrations or public outings ever again? With the high contamination rate, this virus has successfully surmounted into a weapon humans cannot tackle. Recently I found out that the Markham Fair would not be operating for the first time in 176 years, I was shocked that it had lived through past World Wars and pandemics. This virus really knows no boundaries, rich or poor, it treats everyone as equals and removes the traditional social hierarchy of beings. 
</br></br>
To see and experience the collapse of the economy, my favourite pho store finally doing take outs and the rampant spikes of the stock market, there may be permanent changes here that will forever impact our lives. Hair dressers who need to operate on limited imported products and small restaurants who face eviction as they are not able to pay rent, a simple solution we all see coming to bounce back is the inflation of everyday necessities - yeast being one of them!
</br></br>

Some questions we will have to continue asking ourselves include: will travelling/tourism ever be the same again, hopping in an Uber, or even sitting in a random seat in a lecture hall. </p>
