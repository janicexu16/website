										<h2>The Power of E-Commerce</h2>
										<p>"Create Your Own Magic!"</p>
									</header>
									<p>
Since I was a child I loved arts and crafts - it gave me happiness and allowed me to fill an empty void during the boring summers of elementary school. I scavenged through hundreds of stores looking for specific polymer clay colours and going through YouTube videos to better improve my skills. 
<br></br>
In May of 2020 when I was getting increasingly antsy due to the pandemic, I decided to take it upon myself to pick up my long past hobbies and create my own magic. I always had my eye on this one Cricut machine that was sold for $300 but couldn't muster up the justification to invest that much money on a simple hobby which had not even included material costs.
<br></br>
I was inspired to start making custom decals and stickers when my dragon boat team had to pack up all of our paddles to ship out internationally. That's when I realized my paddle was more or less identical to many of my teammates and I had to quickly tie a wad of duck tape to the handle in order to differentiate it.
<br></br>
I started off with a few listings of custom vinyl decals - ones that fit iPhones and AirPods perfectly. Although this was a very popular listing I managed to get a few sales under these categories. One key thing here was product differentiation: sure there were many people offering the same thing but how was the colour selection or even adding additional symbols like hearts. 
<br></br>
When I got tired from this I thought about doing printable stickers from personal artwork - however, the materials on the market all seemed to have some problems. I did a lot more research to look into how people got that high quality glossy print and finally, found the right product and printer to get the job done. 
<br></br>
Timeline 
	<li>June 1: Shop set up with 3 listings </li>
	<li>June 6: First sale </li>
	<li>June 30: Product Extension --> Custom Stickers </li>
	<li>July 27: High of 24 Orders in one day</li>
	<li>July 20: 150 sales reached </li>
	<li>July 30: 300 sales reached </li>
</br>
Overall, there were many lessons to be learned along the way here. Customer service, product management, operations, quality and inventory control just to name a few. Everyday I continue to strive for the best service and quality in prints out there because I understand how frightening it is to make an online purchase, so many factors could go wrong. It brings me so much joy every time a customer mentions how amazing my product is and I continue to strive for better designs and search engine optimization everyday. A small business owner like myself could only imagine how their expansion could look like and I am excited to see what my future in other e-commerce platforms such as Shopify will look like.
